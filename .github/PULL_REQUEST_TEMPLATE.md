<!-- What does this PR change, and why? -->

## Changes

-

## Checklist

- [ ] `fvm flutter analyze` reports no issues.
- [ ] `fvm dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .` passes.
- [ ] `fvm flutter test` passes; new logic is covered by tests where practical.
- [ ] Generated code is regenerated and committed (`fvm dart run build_runner build`).
- [ ] Architecture boundaries are respected (View → Cubit/Bloc → UseCase → Repository), nothing derived is stored, and a sync still never writes the user's tables.
- [ ] A schema change bumps `schemaVersion` and ships with `make-migrations` output and a migration test.
- [ ] Platform features go through a `domain/service` interface, with a fake for tests.
- [ ] UI changes work in dark mode and at large text sizes, and new screens or states are added to the accessibility tour.
- [ ] Docs are updated if behaviour or structure changed.
- [ ] Commit messages follow Conventional Commits.
